	Code maker(Computer) has created the secret code,
the code breaker(Player) may place any combination
of colored guess pegs on the first line of 4 peg holes.
The code maker will use the Cyan(light blue) rectangle,
which indicate each peg that is a correct color but
wrong position, or a Green rectangle to indicate each peg
is in a correct position and a right color. If neither
are true,then no sign should be placed.The answer and
guess pegs stay in their positions until the end of the game.

	Play continues until the code is discovered or
there are no remaining guesses (max 12).
